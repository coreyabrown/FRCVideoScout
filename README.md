# FRCVideoScout
This is an attempt to scout FIRST Robotics Competition robots via videos. 

Ideal workflow and steps that have been completed:

- [ ] Fetch youtube videos from TheBlueAlliance
- [ ] Skim through frames of fetched youtube videos and track robots
- [ ] Plot each robot's course on the field throughout the match
- [ ] Generate heatmaps for each robot at the competition
- [ ] Track key metrics such as starting position, top speed, and others as needed
